If you need help setting up MapProxy, having some trouble or found a bug? There are different ways to get help:

#### Mailing List

The [OSGeo](http://osgeo.org/) is hosting our mailing list: [mapproxy@lists.osgeo.org](http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/mapproxy)

The list is for users and developers and is the best place to discuss MapProxy. You must [subscribe to the list](http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/mapproxy) before you can write. There is an [archive](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/mapproxy/) of all older posts.

### How to ask for help?

There are a few things you should consider when asking for help on the mailing list, that will make it more likely to get a fast *and* helpful response.

*   Describe what you're trying to do and what your end result should be. It's possible that there is an easier way to do something.
*   Always include a minimal configuration to reproduce your setup – including all grids, caches, sources and layers. But remove all unrelated parts, e.g. when you have multiple sources/caches/layers.
*   Describe what you are expecting and what you get. Include URLs you are requesting from MapProxy and URLs of requests that MapProxy makes to your source.
*   Describe what you already tried to do.
*   Include the software versions of your setup (MapProxy, Windows/Linux, Proj4, PIL, etc.).
*   Try to see if it works with `mapproxy-util serve-develop` if your issue is not related to the deployment itself. Copy any error output in your mail.
*   Always include a *minimal* configuration to reproduce your setup.
*   There is a hard limit of 100kB per mail on the mailing list. Avoid HTML, only post tiny pictures and/or use external webspace (or Dropbox) for larger stuff.
*   Use these guidelines with common sense. For example, we don't need your OpenLayers configuration when MapProxy doesn't start up.
