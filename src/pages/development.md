You want to improve MapProxy, found a bug and want to fix it? Great! This document points you to some helpful information.

#### Source

Releases are available from the [PyPI project page of MapProxy](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MapProxy).

MapProxy uses [Git](http://git-scm.com/) as a source control management tool. If you are new to distributed SCMs or Git we recommend to read [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book).

The main (authoritative) repository is hosted at [https://github.com/mapproxy/mapproxy](https://github.com/mapproxy/mapproxy)

To get a copy of the repository call:

    git clone https://github.com/mapproxy/mapproxy

#### Continuous integration

We use github actions to automatically run the MapProxy test suite against different Python versions and also to automatically deploy new releases. ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/mapproxy/mapproxy/actions

#### How to contribute

Questions?  ðŸ‘‰ [mailing list](support) or [issues](https://github.com/mapproxy/mapproxy/issues)  
Code enhancements / bugs ðŸ‘‰ [github](https://github.com/mapproxy/mapproxy)

You can post patches to the mailing list or create a new ticket. Or better, [create a fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) instead and send a pull request. Feel free to post to the [mailing list first](support), if you have any question.

#### More information

There is a [whole chapter about development in the documentation](https://mapproxy.github.io/mapproxy/latest/development.html). It covers most aspects of the MapProxy development including the source code, documentation, tests, etc.
